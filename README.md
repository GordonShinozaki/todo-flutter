# my_todo

A new Flutter project.

This is a very basic Todo App that only has an add and clear feature

## How to run this 

1. Make sure Flutter is installed properly in your system. i.e. "which flutter" command should give an output 
2. Then cd to the my_todo directly and just do "flutter run"
3. Play around
